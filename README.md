# RafflesOrders

RafflesOrders is a canteen ordering website created by Rafflesians, for Rafflesians.
It allows students to order food and drinks from the canteen during the morning or between periods from the website.
This gives the canteen stall owners more time to prepare food, and can help users to skip the long queues.

This project was adapted from an initiative founded by ANDSS Robotics Club, where i worked on this project with Hayden How, Ernest Kiew, Lim Chang Jun etc.

For installation of libraries, download pip and enter "pip install" followed by name in requirements.txt.
This website is made with the flask framework in python along with its many other libraries
